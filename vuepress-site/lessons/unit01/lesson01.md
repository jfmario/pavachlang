# Lesson 1: Greetings

This lesson will focus on basic greetings in the Pavach language.

## Lesson

### Equivalents of "Hello" and "Goodbye"

While there are several greetings common in Pavach, by far the most common
greeting among *peers*
is <PavachTrans text="s.e-dz" /> or the longer form
<PavachTrans text="s.e-dz.o-m" />. These are roughly equivalent to the English
"hi" and "hello", respectively. They are greetings used at the beginning of an 
encounter. A friendly encounter will often end with
<PavachTrans text="g.oi-dz" /> (read as *goydz*) 
or <PavachTrans text="g.oi-dz.o-m" />.

### Hierarchical Greetings

Between people who are not peers, the greetings are different. In formal
environments it is expected that the higher ranking person will greet the lower
ranking person first at the beginning of an encounter,
but even otherwise these same greetings are used.
The higher-to-lower greeting is <PavachTrans text="m.o-f.i-f" />. Some examples
of when this greeting
is used is 
when a general is greeting a soldier, a teacher is greeting a student, or an
adult is greeting a child. The responsive or lower-to-higher greeting is 
<PavachTrans text="m.o-f.e-l" />.

Regardless of social rank differences, the end greeting
<PavachTrans text="g.oi-dz.o-m" /> is usually used at the end of encounters.
